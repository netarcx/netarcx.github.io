Chronicle of a Death Foretold 43 Grabriel Garcia Marquez
 
CHAPTER 4
THE DAMAGE FROM THE KNIVES WAS only a beginning for the unforgiving autopsy
that Father Carmen Amador found himself obliged to perform in Dr. Dionisio Iguaran's
absence. "It was as if we killed him all over again after he was dead," the aged priest told
me in his retirement at Calafell. "But it was an order from the mayor, and orders from the
barbarian, stupid as they might have been, had to be obeyed." It wasn't entirely proper. In
the confusion of that absurd Monday, Colonel Aponte had had an urgent telegraphic
conversation with the governor of the province, and the latter authorised him to take the
preliminary steps while he sent an investigating magistrate. The mayor was a former troop
commander with no experience in matters of law, and he was too conceited to ask anyone
who knew where he should begin. The first thing that bothered him was the autopsy. Cristo
Bedoya, who was a medical student, managed to get out of it because of his intimate
friendship with Santiago Nasar. The mayor thought that the body could be kept under
refrigeration until Dr. Dionisio Iguarلn came back, but he couldn't find a human-sized
freezer, and the only one in the market that would serve the purpose was out of order. The
body had been exposed to public view in the centre of the living room, lying on a narrow
iron cot while they were building a rich man's coffin for it. They'd brought in fans from the
bedrooms and some neighbouring houses, but there were so many people anxious to see it
that they had to push back the furniture and take down the bird cages and pots of ferns, and
even then the heat was unbearable. In addition, the dogs, aroused by the smell of death,
increased the uneasiness. They hadn't stopped howling since I went into the house, when
Santiago Nasar was still in his death throes in the kitchen and I found Divina Flor weeping
in great howls and holding them off with a stick.
 "Help me," she shouted to me. "What they want is to eat his guts."
 We locked them up in the stable. Plلcida Linero later ordered them taken to some
place far off until after the funeral. But toward noon, no one knew how, they escaped from
where they were and burst madly into the house. Plلcida Linero, just once, lost her grip.
 "Those shitty dogs!" she shouted. "Kill them!" 
Chronicle of a Death Foretold 44 Grabriel Garcia Marquez
 
 The order was carried out immediately and the house was silent again. Until then
there hadn't been any concern at all for the state of the body. The face had remained intact,
with the same expression it wore when he was singing, and Cristo Bedoya had put the
intestines back in place and wrapped the body in linen strips. Nevertheless, in the afternoon
a syrup-coloured liquid began to flow from the wounds, drawing flies, and a purple blotch
appeared on the upper lip and spread out very slowly, like the shadow of a cloud on water,
up to the hairline. His face, which had always been easy-going, took on a hostile
expression, and his mother covered it with a handkerchief. Colonel Aponte understood then
that they couldn't wait any longer and he ordered Father Amador to perform the autopsy. "It
would be worse digging him up a week later," he said. The priest had studied medicine and
surgery at Salamanca, but had entered the seminary before he was graduated, and even the
mayor knew that his autopsy would have no legal standing. Nevertheless, he made him
carry out the order.
 It was a massacre, performed at the public school with the help of the druggist,
who took notes, and a first-year medical student who was here on vacation. They had only a
few instruments for minor surgery available and the rest were craftsmen's tools. But despite
the havoc wrought on the body, Father Amador's report seemed in order and the
investigator incorporated it in the brief as a useful piece of evidence.
 Seven of the many wounds were fatal. The liver was almost sliced in pieces by two
deep cuts on the anterior side. He had four incisions in the stomach, one of them so deep
that it went completely through, and destroyed, the pancreas. He had six other, lesser
perforations in the transverse colon and multiple wounds in the small intestine. The only
one he had in the back, at the level of the third lumbar vertebra, had perforated the right
kidney. The abdominal cavity was filled with large clots of blood, and in the midst of the
morass of gastric contents appeared a medal of gold that Santiago Nasar had swallowed at
the age of four. The thoracic cavity showed two perforations: one in the second right rib
space that affected the lung, and another quite close to the left armpit. He also had six
minor wounds on his arms and hands, and two horizontal cuts: one on the right thigh and
the other in the abdominal muscles. He had a deep stab in the right hand. The report says: 
Chronicle of a Death Foretold 45 Grabriel Garcia Marquez
 
"It looked like a stigma of the crucified Christ." The encephalic mass weighed sixty grams
more than that of a normal Englishman, and Father Amador noted in the report that
Santiago Nasar had a superior intelligence and a brilliant future. Nevertheless, in the final
note he pointed out a hypertrophy of the liver that he attributed to a poorly cured case of
hepatitis. "That is to say," he told me, "he had only a few years of life left to him in any
case." Dr. Dionisio Iguarلn, who in fact had treated Santiago Nasar for hepatitis at the age
of twelve, recalled that autopsy with indignation. "Only a priest could be so dumb," he told
me. "There was never any way to make him understand that we tropical people have larger
livers than greenhorn Galician Spaniards." The report concluded that the cause of death had
been a massive haemorrhage brought on by any one of the seven major wounds.
 They gave us back a completely different body. Half of the cranium had been
destroyed by the trepanation, and the lady-killer face that death had preserved ended up
having lost its identity. Furthermore, the priest had pulled out the sliced-up intestines by the
roots, but in the end he didn't know what to do with them, and he gave them an angry
blessing and threw them into the garbage pail. The last onlookers ranged about the
schoolhouse windows lost their curiosity, the helper fainted, and Colonel Lلzaro Aponte,
who had seen and caused so many repressive massacres, became a vegetarian as well as a
spiritualist. The empty shell, stuffed with rags and quicklime and sewed up crudely with
coarse twine and baling needles, was on the point of falling apart when we put it into the
new coffin with its silk quilt lining. "I thought it would last longer that way," Father
Amador told me. Just the opposite happened, and we had to bury him hurriedly at dawn
because he was in such bad shape that it was already unbearable in the house.
 A cloudy Tuesday was breaking through. I didn't have the courage to sleep at the
end of that oppressive time, and I pushed on the door of Maria Alejandrina Cervantes's
house in case she hadn't put up the bar. The gourd lamps were burning where they hung
from the trees, and in the courtyard for dancing there were several wood fires with huge
steaming pots where the mulatto girls were putting mourning dye onto their party clothes. I
found Maria Alejandrina Cervantes awake as always at dawn, and completely naked as
always when there weren't any strangers in the house. She was squatting like a Turkish 
Chronicle of a Death Foretold 46 Grabriel Garcia Marquez
 
houri on her queenly bed across from a Babylonic platter of things to eat: veal cutlets, a
boiled chicken, a pork loin, and a garnishing of plantains and vegetables that would have
served five people. Disproportionate eating was always the only way she could ever mourn
and I'd never seen her do it with such grief. I lay down by her side with my clothes on,
barely speaking, and mourning too in my way. I was thinking about the ferocity of Santiago
Nasar's fate, which had collected twenty years of happiness from him not only with his
death but also with the dismemberment of his body and its dispersion and extermination. I
dreamed that a woman was coming into the room with a little girl in her arms, and that the
child was chewing without stopping to take a breath, and that half-chewed kernels of corn
were falling into the woman's brassiere. The woman said to me: "She crunches like a nutty
nuthatch, kind of sloppy, kind of slurpy." Suddenly I felt the anxious fingers that were
undoing the buttons of my shirt, and I caught the dangerous smell of the beast of love lying
by my back, and I felt myself sinking into the delights of the quicksand of her tenderness.
But suddenly she stopped, coughed from far off, and slipped out of my life.
 "I can't," she said. "You smell of him." Not just I. Everything continued smelling
of Santiago Nasar that day. The Vicario brothers could smell him in the jail cell where the
mayor had locked them up until he could think of something to do with them. "No matter
how much I scrubbed with soap and rags, I couldn't get rid of the smell," Pedro Vicario told
me. They'd gone three nights without sleep, but they couldn't rest because as soon as they
began to fall asleep they would commit the crime all over again. Now, almost an old man,
trying to explain to me his condition on that endless day, Pablo Vicario told me without any
effort: "It was like being awake twice over." That phrase made me think that what must
have been most unbearable for them in jail was their lucidity.
 The room was ten feet square, and had a very high skylight with iron bars, a
portable latrine, a washstand with its pitcher and basin, and two makeshift beds with straw
mats. Colonel Aponte, under whose orders it had been built, said that no hotel existed that
was more humane. My brother Luis Enrique agreed, because one night they'd locked him
up after a fight among musicians, and the mayor allowed him the charity of having one of
the mulatto girls stay with him. Perhaps the Vicario brothers could have thought the same 
Chronicle of a Death Foretold 47 Grabriel Garcia Marquez
 
thing at eight o'clock in the morning, when they felt themselves safe from the Arabs. At that
moment they were comforted by the honour of having done their duty, and the only thing
that worried them was the persistence of the smell. They asked for lots of water, laundry
soap, and rags, and they washed the blood from their arms and faces, and they also washed
their shirts, but they couldn't get any rest. Pedro Vicario asked for his laxatives and
diuretics and a roll of sterile gauze so he could change his bandage, and he succeeded in
having two urinations during the morning. Nevertheless, life was becoming so difficult for
him as the day advanced that the smell took second place. At two in the afternoon, when the
heaviness of the heat should have melted them, Pedro Vicario couldn't stay there lying on
the bed, but the same weariness prevented him from standing. The pain in his groin had
reached his throat, his urine was shut off, and he suffered the frightful certainty that he
wouldn't sleep ever again for the rest of his life. "I was awake for eleven months," he told
me, and I knew him well enough to know that it was true. He couldn't eat any lunch. Pablo
Vicario, for his part, ate a little bit of everything they brought him, and fifteen minutes later
unloosed a pestilential diarrhoea. At six in the afternoon, while they were performing the
autopsy on Santiago Nasar's corpse, the mayor was summoned urgently because Pedro
Vicario was convinced that his brother had been poisoned. "He was turning into water right
in front of me," Pedro Vicario told me, "and we couldn't get rid of the idea that it was some
trick of the Turks." Up till then he'd overflowed the portable latrine twice and the guard on
watch had taken him to the town hall washroom another six times. There Colonel Aponte
found him, in the doorless toilet boxed in by the guard, and pouring out water so fluently
that it wasn't too absurd to think about poison. But they put the idea aside immediately
when it was established that he had only drunk the water and eaten the food sent by Pura
Vicario. Nonetheless, the mayor was so impressed that he had the prisoners taken to his
house under a special guard until the investigating judge came and transferred them to the
panoptic prison in Riohacha.
 The twins' fear was in response to the mood in the streets. Revenge by the Arabs
wasn't dismissed, but no one, except the Vicario brothers, had thought of poison. It was
supposed, rather, that they would wait for nightfall in order to pour gasoline through the 
Chronicle of a Death Foretold 48 Grabriel Garcia Marquez
 
skylight and burn up the prisoners in their cell. But even that was too easy a supposition.
The Arabs comprised a community of peaceful immigrants who had settled at the beginning
of the century in Caribbean towns, even in the poorest and most remote, and there they
remained, selling coloured cloth and bazaar trinkets. They were clannish, hardworking, and
Catholic. They married among themselves, imported their wheat, raised lambs in their
yards, and grew oregano and eggplants, and playing cards was their only driving passion.
The older ones continued speaking the rustic Arabic they had brought from their homeland,
and they maintained it intact in the family down to the second generation, but those of the
third, with the exception of Santiago Nasar, listened to their parents in Arabic and answered
them in Spanish. So it was inconceivable that they would suddenly abandon their pastoral
spirit to avenge a death for which we all could have been to blame. On the other hand, no
one thought about reprisals from Plلcida Linero's family, who had been powerful and
fighting people until their fortune ran out, and had bred more than two barroom killers who
had been preserved by the salt of their name.
 Colonel Aponte, worried by the rumours, visited the Arabs family by family and
that time, at least, drew a correct conclusion. He found them perplexed and sad, with signs
of mourning on their altars, and some of them sitting on the ground and wailing, but none
harboured ideas of vengeance. The reaction that morning had grown out of the heat of the
crime, and even the very leaders admitted that in no case would it have gone beyond a
beating. Furthermore, it was Susana Abdala, the centenarian matriarch, who recommended
the prodigious infusion of passion flowers and absinthe that dried up Pablo Vicario's
diarrhoea and unleashed at the same time his brother's florid flow. Pedro Vicario then fell
into an insomniac drowsiness and his recovered brother earned his first sleep without
remorse. That was how Pure sima Vicario found them at three o'clock in the morning on
Tuesday when the mayor brought her to say good-bye to them. The whole family left, even
the older sisters with their husbands, on Colonel Aponte's initiative. They left without
anyone's noticing, sheltered by public exhaustion, while the only survivors of that
irreparable day among us who were awake were burying Santiago Nasar. They were
leaving until spirits cooled off, according to the mayor's decision, but they never came 
Chronicle of a Death Foretold 49 Grabriel Garcia Marquez
 
back. Pura Vicario wrapped the face of the rejected daughter in a cloth so that no one would
see the bruises, and she dressed her in bright red so nobody might think she was mourning
her secret lover. Before leaving she asked Father Amador to confess her sons in jail, but
Pedro Vicario refused, and convinced his brother that they had nothing to repent. They
remained alone, and on the day of their transfer to Riohacha they had so far recovered and
were so convinced that they were right that they didn't want to be taken out by night, as had
happened with the family, but in broad daylight and with their faces showing. Poncio
Vicario, the father, died a short time later. "His moral pain carried him off," Angela Vicario
told me. When the twins were absolved, they remained in Riohacha, only a day's trip from
Manaure, where the family was living. Prudencia Cotes went there to marry Pablo Vicario,
who learned to work with precious metals in his father's shop and came to be an elegant
goldsmith. Pedro Vicario, without love or a job, re-enlisted in the armed forces three years
later, earned his first sergeant's stripes, and one fine morning his patrol went into guerrilla
territory singing whorehouse songs and was never heard of again.
 For the immense majority of people there was only one victim: Bayardo San
Roman. They took it for granted that the other actors in the tragedy had been fulfilling with
dignity, and even with a certain grandeur, their part of the destiny that life had assigned
them. Santiago Nasar had expiated the insult, the brothers Vicario had proved their status as
men, and the seduced sister was in possession of her honour once more. The only one who
had lost everything was Bayardo San Roman: "poor Bayardo," as he was remembered over
the years. Still, no one had thought of him until after the eclipse of the moon the following
Saturday, when the widower Xius told the mayor that he'd seen a phosphorescent bird
fluttering over his former home, and he thought it was the soul of his wife, who was going
about demanding what was hers. The mayor slapped his brow, but it had nothing to do with
the widower's vision.
 "Shit!" he shouted. "I'd completely forgotten about that poor man!"
 He went up the hill with a patrol and found the car with its top down in front of the
farmhouse, and he saw a solitary light in the bedroom, but no one answered his knocks. So
they broke down a side door and searched the rooms, which were lighted by the traces of 
Chronicle of a Death Foretold 50 Grabriel Garcia Marquez
 
the eclipse. "Things looked like they were under water," the mayor told me. Bayardo San
Roman was unconscious on the bed, still the way Pura Vicario had seen him early Tuesday
morning, wearing his dress pants and silk shirt, but with his shoes off. There were empty
bottles on the floor and many more unopened beside the bed, but not a trace of food. "He
was in the last stages of ethylic intoxication," I was told by Dr. Dionisio Iguarلn, who had
given him emergency treatment. But he recovered in a few hours, and as soon as his mind
had cleared, he threw them out of the house with the best manners he was capable of.
 "Nobody fucks with me," he said. "Not even my father with his war veteran's
balls."
 The mayor informed General Petronio San Roman of the episode, down to the last
literal phrase, in an alarming telegram. General San Roman must have followed his son's
wishes to the letter, because he didn't come for him, but sent his wife with their daughters
and two other older women who seemed to be her sisters. They came on a cargo boat,
locked in mourning up to their necks because of Bayardo San Roman's misfortunes, and
with their hair hanging loose in grief. Before stepping onto land, they took off their shoes
and went barefoot through the streets up to the hilltop in the burning dust of noon, pulling
out strands of hair by the roots and wailing loudly with such high-pitched shrieks that they
seemed to be shouts of joy. I watched them pass from Magdalena Oliver's balcony, and I
remember thinking that distress like theirs could only be put on in order to hide other,
greater shames.
 Colonel Lلzaro Aponte accompanied them to the house on the hill, and then Dr.
Dionisio Iguarلn went up on the mule he kept for emergencies. When the sun let up, two
men from the town government brought Bayardo San Roman down in a hammock hanging
from a pole, wrapped up to his neck in a blanket and with a retinue of wailing women.
Magdalena Oliver thought he was dead.
 "Collons de déu!" she exclaimed. "What a waste!"
 He was laid out by alcohol again, but it was hard to believe they were carrying a
living person, because his right arm was dragging on the ground, and as soon as his mother
put it back inside the hammock it would fall out again, so that he left a trail on the ground 
Chronicle of a Death Foretold 51 Grabriel Garcia Marquez
 
from the edge of the precipice to the deck of the boat. That was all that we had left of him:
the memory of a victim.
 They left the farmhouse the way it was. My brothers and I would go up to explore
it on carousing nights when we were home on vacation, and each time we found fewer
things of value in the abandoned rooms. Once we rescued the small valise that Angela
Vicario had asked her mother for on her wedding night, but we didn't pay any great
attention to it. What we discovered inside seemed to be a woman's natural items for hygiene
and beauty, and I only learned their real use when Angela Vicario told me many years later
which things were the old wives' artifices she had been instructed in so as to deceive her
husband. It was the only trace she'd left in what had been her home as a married woman for
five hours.
 Years later when I came back to search out the last pieces of testimony for this
chronicle, not even the embers of Yolanda Xius's happiness remained. Things had been
disappearing little by little, despite Colonel Lلzaro Aponte's determined vigilance, even the
full-length closet with six mirrors that the master craftsmen of Mom-pox had had to
assemble inside the house because it wouldn't fit through the door. At first the widower
Xius was overjoyed, thinking that all those were the posthumous recourses of his wife in
carrying off what was hers. Colonel Lلzaro Aponte made fun of him. But one night it
occurred to him to hold a spiritualist seance in order to clear up the mystery, and the soul of
Yolanda Xius confirmed in her own handwriting that it was in fact she who was recovering
the knick-knacks of her happiness for her house of death. The house began to crumble. The
wedding car was falling apart by the door, and finally nothing remained except its weatherrotted
carcass. For many years nothing was heard again of its owner. There is a declaration
by him in the brief, but it is so short and conventional that it seems to have been put
together at the last minute in order to comply with an unavoidable requirement. The only
time I tried to talk to him, twenty-three years later, he received me with a certain
aggressiveness and refused to supply even the most insignificant fact that might clarify a
little his participation in the drama. In any case, not even his family knew much more about 
Chronicle of a Death Foretold 52 Grabriel Garcia Marquez
 
him than we did, nor did they have the slightest idea of what he had come to do in a mislaid
town, with no other apparent aim than to marry a woman he had never seen."
 Of Angela Vicario, on the other hand, I was always receiving periodic news that
inspired an idealised image in me. My sister the nun had been going about the upper
Guajira for some time trying to convert the last idolaters, and she was in the habit of
stopping and chatting with Angela in the village baked by Caribbean salt where her mother
had tried to bury her alive. "Regards from your cousin," she would always tell me. My
sister Margot, who also visited her during the first years, told me she had bought a solid
house with a large courtyard with cross ventilation, the only problem being that on nights of
high tide the toilets would back up and fish would appear flopping about in the bedrooms at
dawn. Everyone who saw her during that time agreed that she was absorbed and skilled at
her embroidery machine, and that by her industry she had managed to forget.
 Much later, during an uncertain period when I was trying to understand something
of myself by selling encyclopaedias and medical books in the towns of Guajira, by chance I
got as far as that Indian death village. At the window of a house that faced the sea,
embroidering by machine during the hottest hour of the day, was a woman half in
mourning, with steel-rimmed glasses and yellowish grey hair, and hanging above her head
was a cage with a canary that didn't stop singing. When I saw her like that in the idyllic
frame of the window, I refused to believe that the woman there was who I thought it was,
because I couldn't bring myself to admit that life might end up resembling bad literature so
much. But it was she: Angela Vicario, twenty-three years after the drama.
 She treated me the same as always, like a distant cousin, and answered my
questions with very good judgment and a sense of humour. She was so mature and witty
that it was difficult to believe that she was the same person. What surprised me most was
the way in which she'd ended up understanding her own life. After a few minutes she no
longer seemed as aged to me as at first sight, but almost as young as in my memory, and
she had nothing in common with the person who'd been obliged to marry without love at
the age of twenty. Her mother, in her grouchy old age, received me like a difficult ghost.
She refused to talk about the past, and for this chronicle I had to be satisfied with a few 
Chronicle of a Death Foretold 53 Grabriel Garcia Marquez
 
disconnected phrases from her conversations with my mother, and a few others rescued
from my memories. She had gone beyond what was possible to make Angela Vicario die in
life, but the daughter herself had brought her plans to naught because she never made any
mystery out of her misfortune. On the contrary, she would recount it in all its details to
anyone who wanted to hear it, except for one item that would never be cleared up: who was
the real cause of her damage, and how and why, because no one believed that it had really
been Santiago Nasar. They belonged to two completely different worlds. No one had ever
seen them together, much less alone together. Santiago Nasar was too haughty to have
noticed her: "Your cousin the booby," he would say to me when he had to mention her.
Besides, as we said at that time, he was a sparrow hawk. He went about alone, just like his
father, nipping the bud of any wayward virgin who began showing up in those woods, but
in town no other relationship ever came to be known except for the conventional one he
maintained with Flora Miguel, and the stormy one with Maria Alejandrina Cervantes,
which drove him crazy for fourteen months. The most current version, perhaps because it
was the most perverse, was that Angela Vicario was protecting someone who really loved
her and she had chosen Santiago Nasar's name because she thought her brothers would
never dare go up against him. I tried to get that truth out of her myself when I visited her
the second time, with all my arguments in order, but she barely lifted her eyes from the
embroidery to knock them down. "Don't beat it to death, cousin," she told me. "He was the
one."
 Everything else she told without reticence, even the disaster of her wedding night.
She recounted how her friends had instructed her to get her husband drunk in bed until he
passed out, to feign more embarrassment than she really felt so he'd turn out the light, to
give herself a drastic douche of alum water to fake virginity, and to stain the sheet with
Mercurochrome so she could display it the following day in her bridal courtyard. Her
bawds hadn't counted on two things: Bayardo San Roman's exceptional resistance as a
drinker, and the pure decency that Angela Vicario carried hidden inside the stolidity her
mother had imposed. "I didn't do any of what they told me," she said, "because the more I
thought about it, the more I realised that it was all something dirty that shouldn't be done to 
Chronicle of a Death Foretold 54 Grabriel Garcia Marquez
 
anybody, much less to the poor man who had the bad luck to marry me." So she let herself
get undressed openly in the lighted bedroom, safe now from all the acquired fears that had
ruined her life. "It was very easy," she told me, "because I'd made up my mind to die."
 The truth is that she spoke about her misfortune without any shame in order to
cover up the other misfortune, the real one, that was burning in her insides. No one would
even have suspected until she decided to tell me that Bayardo San Roman had been in her
life forever from the moment he'd brought her back home. It was a coup de grace.
"Suddenly, when Mama began to hit me, I began to remember him," she told me. The
blows hurt less because she knew they were for him. She went on thinking about him with a
certain surprise at herself while she was lying on the dining room couch sobbing. "I wasn't
crying because of the blows or anything that had happened," she told me. "I was crying
because of him." She kept on thinking about him while her mother put arnica compresses
on her face, and even more when she heard the shouting in the street and the fire alarm bells
in the belfry, and her mother came in to tell her she could sleep now because the worst was
over.
 She'd been thinking about him for a long time, without any illusions, when she had
to go with her mother to get her eyes examined in the hospital at Riohacha. They stopped
off on the way at the Hotel del Puerto, whose owner they knew, and Pura Vicario asked for
a glass of water at the bar. She was drinking it with her back to her daughter when the latter
saw her own thoughts reflected in the mirrors repeated around the room. Angela Vicario
turned her head with a last breath and watched him pass by without seeing her and saw him
go out of the hotel. Then she looked at her mother with her heart in shreds. Pura Vicario
had finished drinking, dried her lips on her sleeve, and smiled at her from the bar with her
new glasses. In that smile, for the first time since her birth, Angela Vicario saw her as she
was: a poor woman devoted to the cult of her defects. "Shit," she said to herself. She was so
upset that she spent the whole trip back home singing aloud, and she threw herself on her
bed to weep for three days.
 She was reborn. "I went crazy over him," she told me, "out of my mind." She only
had to close her eyes to see him, she heard him breathing in the sea, the blaze of his body in 
Chronicle of a Death Foretold 55 Grabriel Garcia Marquez
 
bed would awaken her at midnight. Toward the end of that week, unable to get a moment's
rest, she wrote him the first letter. It was a conventional missive, in which she told him that
she'd seen him come out of the hotel, and that she would have liked it if he had seen her.
She waited in vain for a reply. At the end of two months, tired of waiting, she sent him
another letter in the same oblique style as the previous one, whose only aim seemed to be to
reproach him for his lack of courtesy. Six months later she had written six letters with no
reply, but she comforted herself with the certainty that he was getting them.
 Mistress of her fate for the first time, Angela Vicario then discovered that hate and
love are reciprocal passions. The more letters she sent the more the coals of her fever
burned, but the happy rancour she felt for her mother also heated up. "Just seeing her would
turn my stomach," she told me, "but I couldn't see her without remembering him." Her life
as a rejected wife continued on, simple as that of an old maid, still doing machine
embroidery with her friends just as before she had made cloth tulips and paper birds, but
when her mother went to bed she would stay in the room until dawn writing letters with no
future. She became lucid, overbearing, mistress of her own free will, and she became a
virgin again just for him, and she recognised no other authority than her own nor any other
service than that of her obsession.
 She wrote a weekly letter for over half a lifetime. "Sometimes I couldn't think of
what to say," she told me, dying with laughter, "but it was enough for me to know that he
was getting them." At first they were a fiancee's notes, then they were little messages from
a secret lover, perfumed cards from a furtive sweetheart, business papers, love documents,
and lastly they were the indignant letters of an abandoned wife who invented cruel illnesses
to make him return. One night, in a good mood, she spilled the inkwell over the finished
letter and instead of tearing it up she added a postscript: "As proof of my love I send you
my tears." On occasion, tired of weeping, she would make fun of her own madness. Six
times the post-mistresses were changed and six times she wore their complicity. The only
thing that didn't occur to her was to give up. Nevertheless, he seemed insensible to her
delirium; it was like writing to nobody. 
Chronicle of a Death Foretold 56 Grabriel Garcia Marquez
 
 Early one windy morning in the tenth year, she was awakened by the certainty that
he was naked in her bed. Then she wrote him a feverish letter, twenty pages long, in which
without shame she let out the bitter truths that she had carried rotting in her heart ever since
that ill-fated night. She spoke to him of the eternal scars he had left on her body, the salt of
his tongue, the fiery furrow of his African tool. On Friday she gave it to the postmistress
who came Friday afternoons to embroider with her and pick up the letters, and she was
convinced that that final alleviation would be the end of her agony. But there was no reply.
From then on she was no longer conscious of what she wrote nor to whom she was really
writing, but she kept on without quarter for seventeen years.
 Halfway through one August day, while she was embroidering with her friends,
she heard someone coming to the door. She didn't have to look to see who it was. "He was
fat and was beginning to lose his hair, and he already needed glasses to see things close by,"
she told me. "But it was him, God damn it, it was him!" She was frightened because she
knew he was seeing her just as diminished as she saw him, and she didn't think he had as
much love inside as she to bear up under it. His shirt was soaked in sweat, as she had seen
him the first time at the fair, and he was wearing the same belt, and carrying the same
unstitched leather saddlebags with silver decorations. Bayardo San Roman took a step
forward, unconcerned about the other astonished embroiderers, and laid his saddlebags on
the sewing machine.
 "Well," he said, "here I am."
 He was carrying a suitcase with clothing in order to stay and another just like it
with almost two thousand letters that she had written him. They were arranged by date in
bundles tied with coloured ribbons, and they were all unopened.

CHAPTER 5
FOR YEARS WE COULDN'T TALK ABOUT anything else. Our daily conduct,
dominated then by so many linear habits, had suddenly begun to spin around a single
common anxiety. The cocks of dawn would catch us trying to give order to the chain of
many chance events that had made absurdity possible, and it was obvious that we weren't
doing it from an urge to clear up mysteries but because none of us could go on living
without an exact knowledge of the place and the mission assigned to us by fate.
 Many never got to know. Cristo Bedoya, who went on to become a surgeon of
renown, never managed to explain to himself why he gave in to the impulse to spend two
hours at his grandparents' house until the bishop came instead of going to rest at his
parents', who had been waiting for him since dawn to warn him.
 But most of those who could have done something to prevent the crime and did not
consoled themselves with the pretext that affairs of honour are sacred monopolies, giving
access only to those who are part of the drama. "Honour is love," I heard my mother say.
Hortensia Baute, whose only participation was having seen two bloody knives that weren't
bloody yet, felt so affected by the hallucination that she fell into a penitential crisis, and one
day, unable to stand it any longer, she ran out naked into the street. Flora Miguel, Santiago
Nasar's fiancee, ran away out of spite with a lieutenant of the border patrol, who prostituted
her among the rubber workers on the Vichada. Aura Villeros, the midwife who had helped
bring three generations into the world, suffered a spasm of the bladder when she heard the
news and to the day of her death had to use a catheter in order to urinate. Don Rogelio de la
Flor, Clotilde Armenta's good husband, who was a marvel of vitality at the age of eightysix,
got up for the last time to see how they had hewn Santiago Nasar to bits against the
locked door of his own house, and he didn't survive the shock. Plلcida Linero had locked
that door at the last moment, but with the passage of time she freed herself from blame. "I
locked it because Divina Flor had sworn to me that she'd seen my son come in," she told
me, "and it wasn't true." On the other hand, she never forgave herself for having mixed up
the magnificent augury of trees with the unlucky one of birds, and she succumbed to the
pernicious habit of her time of chewing pepper cress seeds. 
Chronicle of a Death Foretold 58 Grabriel Garcia Marquez
 
 Twelve days after the crime, the investigating magistrate came upon a town that
was an open wound. In the squalid wooden office in the town hall, drinking pot coffee laced
with cane liquor against the mirages of the heat, he had to ask for troop reinforcements to
control the crowd that was pouring in to testify without having been summoned, everyone
eager to show off his own important role in the drama. The magistrate was newly graduated
and still wore his black linen law school suit and the gold ring with the emblem of his
degree, and he had the airs and the lyricism of a happy new parent. But I never discovered
his name. Everything we know about his character has been learned from the brief, which
several people helped me look for twenty years later in the Palace of Justice in Riohacha.
There was no classification of files whatever, and more than a century of cases were piled
up on the floor of the decrepit colonial building that had been Sir Francis Drake's
headquarters for two days. The ground floor would be flooded by high tides and the
unbound volumes floated about the deserted offices. I searched many times with the water
up to my ankles in that lagoon of lost causes, and after five years rummaging around only
chance let me rescue some 322 pages filched from the more than 500 that the brief must
have contained.
 The judge's name didn't appear on any of them, but it was obvious that he was a
man burning with the fever of literature. He had doubtless read the Spanish classics and a
few Latin ones, and he was quite familiar with Nietzsche, who was the fashionable author
among magistrates of his time. The marginal notes, and not just because of the colour of the
ink, seemed to be written in blood. He was so perplexed by the enigma that fate had
touched him with, that he kept falling into lyrical distractions that ran contrary to the rigour
of his profession. Most of all, he never thought it legitimate that life should make use of so
many coincidences forbidden literature, so that there should be the untrammelled fulfilment
of a death so clearly foretold.
 Nevertheless, what had alarmed him most at the conclusion of his excessive
diligence was not having found a single clue, not even the most improbable, that Santiago
Nasar had been the cause of the wrong. The friends of Angela Vicario who had been her
accomplices in the deception went on saying for a long time that she had shared her secret 
Chronicle of a Death Foretold 59 Grabriel Garcia Marquez
 
with them before the wedding, but that she hadn't revealed any name. In the brief, they
declared: "She told us about the miracle but not the saint." Angela Vicario, for her part,
wouldn't budge. When the investigating magistrate asked her with his oblique style if she
knew who the decedent Santiago Nasar was, she answered him impassively: "He was my
perpetrator."
 That's the way she swears in the brief, but with no further precision of either how
or where. During the trial, which lasted only three days, the representative of the people put
his greatest effort into the weakness of that charge. Such was the perplexity of the
investigating magistrate over the lack of proof against Santiago Nasar that his good work at
times seemed ruined by disillusionment. On folio 416, in his own handwriting and with the
druggist's red ink, he wrote a marginal note: Give me a prejudice and I will move the world.
Under that paraphrase of discouragement, in a merry sketch with the same blood ink, he
drew a heart pierced by an arrow. For him, just as for Santiago Nasar's closest friends, the
victim's very behaviour during his last hours was overwhelming proof of his innocence.
 On the morning of his death, in fact, Santiago Nasar hadn't had a moment of doubt,
in spite of the fact that he knew very well what the price of the insult imputed to him was.
He was aware of the prudish disposition of his world, and he must have understood that the
twins' simple nature was incapable of resisting an insult. No one knew Bayardo San Roman
very well, but Santiago Nasar knew him well enough to know that underneath his worldly
airs he was as subject as anyone else to his native prejudices. So the murdered man's refusal
to worry could have been suicide. Besides, when he finally learned at the last moment that
the Vicario brothers were waiting for him to kill him, his reaction was not one of panic, as
has so often been said, but rather the bewilderment of innocence.
 My personal impression is that he died without understanding his death. After he'd
promised my sister Margot that he would come and have breakfast at our house, Cristo
Bedoya took him by the arm as they strolled along the dock and both seemed so
unconcerned that they gave rise to false impressions. "They were both going along so
contentedly," Merne Loiza told me, "that I gave thanks to God, because I thought the matter
had been cleared up." Not everybody loved Santiago Nasar so much, of course. Polo 
Chronicle of a Death Foretold 60 Grabriel Garcia Marquez
 
Carrillo, the owner of the electric plant, thought that his serenity wasn't innocence but
cynicism.
 "He thought that his money made him untouchable," he told me. Fausta Lopez, his
wife, commented: "Just like all Turks." Indalecio Pardo had just passed by Clotilde
Armenta's store and the twins had told him that as soon as the bishop left, they were going
to kill Santiago Nasar. Like so many others, he thought these were the usual fantasies of
very early risers, but Clotilde Armenta made him see that it was true, and she asked him to
get to Santiago Nasar and warn him.
 "Don't bother," Pedro Vicario told him. "No matter what, he's as good as dead
already."
 It was too obvious a challenge: the twins knew the bonds between Indalecio Pardo
and Santiago Nasar, and they must have thought that he was just the right person to stop the
crime without bringing any shame on them. But Indalecio found Santiago Nasar being led
by the arm by Cristo Bedoya among the groups that were leaving the docks, and he didn't
dare warn him. "I lost my nerve," he told me. He gave each one a pat on the back and let
them go their way. They scarcely noticed, because they were still taken up with the costs of
the wedding.
 The people were breaking up and heading toward the square the same way they
were. It was a thick crowd, but Scoldastica Cisneros thought she noticed that the two
friends were walking in the centre of it without any difficulty, inside an empty circle,
because everyone knew that Santiago Nasar was about to die and they didn't dare touch
him. Cristo Bedoya also remembered a strange attitude toward them. "They were looking at
us as if we had our faces painted," he told me. Also, Sara Noriega was opening her shoe
store at the moment they passed and she was frightened at Santiago Nasar's paleness. But he
calmed her down.
 "You can imagine, Missy Sara," he told her without stopping, "with this
hangover!"
 Celeste Dangond was sitting in his pyjamas by the door of his house, mocking
those who had gone to greet the bishop, and he invited Santiago Nasar to have some coffee. 
Chronicle of a Death Foretold 61 Grabriel Garcia Marquez
 
"It was in order to gain some time to think," he told me. But Santiago Nasar answered that
he was in a hurry to change clothes to have breakfast with my sister. "I got all mixed up,"
Celeste Dangond told me, "because it suddenly seemed to me that they couldn't be killing
him if he was so sure of what he was going to do." Yamil Shaium was the only one who did
what he had proposed doing. As soon as he heard the rumour, he went out to the door of his
dry goods store and waited for Santiago Nasar so he could warn him. He was one of the last
Arabs who had come with Ibrahim Nasar, had been his partner in cards until his death, and
was still the hereditary counsellor of the family. No one had as much authority as he to talk
to Santiago Nasar. Nevertheless, he thought that if the rumour was baseless it would alarm
him unnecessarily, and he preferred to consult first with Cristo Bedoya in case the latter
was better informed. He called to him as he went by. Cristo Bedoya gave a pat on the back
to Santiago Nasar, who was already at the corner of the square, and answered Yamil
Shaium's call. "See you Saturday," he told him.
 Santiago Nasar didn't reply, but said something in Arabic to Yamil Shaium, and
the latter answered him, also in Arabic, twisting with laughter. "It was a play on words we
always had fun with," Yamil Shaium told me. Without stopping, Santiago Nasar waved
good-bye to both of them and turned the corner of the square. It was the last time they saw
him.
 Cristo Bedoya only took the time to grasp Yamil Shaium's information before he
ran out of the store to catch Santiago Nasar. He'd seen him turn the corner, but he couldn't
find him - among the groups that were beginning to break up on the square. Several people
he asked gave him the same answer.
 "I just saw him with you."
 It seemed impossible that he could have reached home in such a short time, but
just in case, he went in to ask about him since he found the front door unbarred and ajar. He
went in without seeing the paper on the floor. He passed through the shadowy living room,
trying not to make any noise, because it was still too early for visitors, but the dogs became
aroused at the back of the house and came out to meet him. He calmed them down with his
keys as he'd learned from their master, and went on toward the kitchen, with them 
Chronicle of a Death Foretold 62 Grabriel Garcia Marquez
 
following. On the veranda he came upon Divina Flor, who was carrying a pail of water and
a rag to clean the floor in the living room. She assured him that Santiago Nasar hadn't
returned. Victoria Guzman had just put the rabbit stew on the stove when he entered the
kitchen. She understood immediately. "His heart was in his mouth," she told me. Cristo
Bedoya asked her if Santiago Nasar was home, and she answered him with feigned
innocence that he still hadn't come in to go to sleep, "It's serious," Cristo Bedoya told her.
"They're looking for him to kill him."
 Victoria Guzman forgot her innocence.
 "Those poor boys won't kill anybody," she said.
 "They've been drinking since Saturday," Cristo Bedoya said.
 "That's just it," she replied. "There's no drunk in the world who'll eat his own crap."
 Cristo Bedoya went back to the living room, where Divina Flor had just opened
the windows. "Of course it wasn't raining," Cristo Bedoya told me. "It was just going on
seven and a golden sun was already coming through the windows." He asked Divina Flor
again if she was sure that Santiago Nasar hadn't come in through the living room door. She
wasn't as sure then as the first time. He asked her about Plلcida Linero, and she answered
that just a moment before she'd put her coffee on the night table, but she hadn't awakened
her. That's the way it always was: Plلcida Linero would wake up at seven, have her coffee,
and come down to give instructions for lunch. Cristo Bedoya looked at the clock: it was six
fifty-six. Then he climbed up to the second floor to make sure that Santiago Nasar hadn't
come in.
 The bedroom was locked from the inside, because Santiago Nasar had gone out
through his mother's bedroom. Cristo Bedoya not only knew the house as well as his own,
but was so much at home with the family that he pushed open the door to Plلcida Linero's
bedroom and went from there into the adjoining one. A beam of dusty light was coming in
through the skylight, and the beautiful woman asleep on her side in the hammock, her
bride's hand on her cheek, had an unreal look. "It was like an apparition," Cristo Bedoya
told me. He looked at her for an instant, fascinated by her beauty, and then he crossed the
room in silence, passed by the bathroom, and proceeded into Santiago Nasar's bedroom. 
Chronicle of a Death Foretold 63 Grabriel Garcia Marquez
 
The bed was still made, and on the chair, well-pressed, were his riding clothes, and on top
of the clothes his horseman's hat, and on the floor his boots beside their spurs. On the night
table, Santiago Nasar's wristwatch said six fifty-eight. "Suddenly I thought that he'd come
back so that he could go out armed," Cristo Bedoya told me. But he found the Magnum in
the drawer of the night table. "I'd never shot a gun," Cristo Bedoya told me, "but I decided
to take the revolver and bring it to Santiago Nasar." He stuck it in his belt, under his shirt,
and only after the crime did he realise that it was unloaded. Plلcida Linero appeared in the
doorway with her mug of coffee just as he was closing the drawer.
 "Good heavens!" she exclaimed. "You gave me a start!"
 Cristo Bedoya was also startled. He saw her in the full light, wearing a dressing
gown with golden larks, her hair loose, and the charm had vanished. He explained,
somewhat confused, that he was looking for Santiago Nasar.
 "He went to receive the bishop," Plلcida Linero said.
 "The bishop went right through," he said.
 "I thought so," she said. "He's the son of the worst kind of mother."
 She didn't go on because at that moment she realised that Cristo Bedoya didn't
know what to do with his body. "I hope that God has forgiven me," Plلcida Linero told me,
"but he seemed so confused that it suddenly occurred to me that he'd come to rob us." She
asked him what was wrong. Cristo Bedoya was aware that he was in a suspicious situation,
but he didn't have the courage to reveal the truth.
 "It's just that I haven't had a minute's sleep," he told her.
 He left without any further explanations. "In any case," he told me, "she was
always imagining that she was being robbed." In the square he ran into Father Amador, who
was returning to the church with the vestments for the frustrated mass, but he didn't think he
could do anything for Santiago Nasar except save his soul. He was heading toward the
docks again when he heard them calling him from the door of Clotilde Armenta's store.
Pedro Vicario was in the doorway, pale and haggard, his shirt open and his sleeves rolled
up to the elbows, and with the naked knife in his hand. His manner was too insolent to be 
Chronicle of a Death Foretold 64 Grabriel Garcia Marquez
 
natural, and yet it wasn't the only final or the most visible pose that he'd assumed in the last
moments so they would stop him from committing the crime.
 "Cristobal," he shouted, "tell Santiago Nasar that we're waiting for him here to kill him."
 Cristo Bedoya could have done him the favour of stopping him. "If I'd known how
to shoot a revolver, Santiago Nasar would be alive today," he told me. But the idea did
impress him, after all he'd heard about the devastating power of an armour plated bullet.
 "I warn you. He's armed with a Magnum that can go through an engine block," he shouted.
 Pedro Vicario knew it wasn't true. "He never went armed except when he wore
riding clothes," he told me. But in any case, he'd foreseen the possibility that he might be
armed when he made the decision to wipe his sister's honour clean.
 "Dead men can't shoot," he shouted.
Then Pablo Vicario appeared in the doorway. He was as pale as his brother and he
was wearing his wedding jacket and carrying his knife wrapped in the newspaper. "If it
hadn't been for that," Cristo Bedoya told me, "I never would have known which of the two
was which." Clotilde Armenta then appeared behind Pablo Vicario and shouted to Cristo
Bedoya to hurry up, because in that faggot town only a man like him could prevent the
tragedy.
 Everything that happened after that is in the public domain. The people who were
coming back from the docks, alerted by the shouts, began to take up positions around the
square to witness the crime. Cristo Bedoya asked several people he knew if they'd seen
Santiago Nasar, but no one had. At the door of the social club he ran into Colonel Lلzaro
Aponte and he told him what had just happened in front of Clotilde Armenta's store.
 "It can't be," Colonel Aponte said, "because I told them to go home to bed."
 "I just saw them with pig-killing knives," Cristo Bedoya said.
 "It can't be, because I took them away from them before sending them home to
bed," said the mayor. "It must be that you saw them before that."
 "I saw them two minutes ago and they both had pig-killing knives," Cristo Bedoya said.
 "Oh, shit," the mayor said. "Then they must have come back with two new ones." 
Chronicle of a Death Foretold 65 Grabriel Garcia Marquez
 
 He promised to take care of it at once, but he went into the social club to check on
a date for dominoes that night, and when he came out again the crime had already been
committed. Cristo Bedoya then made his only mortal mistake: he thought that Santiago
Nasar had decided at the last moment to have breakfast at our house before changing his
clothes, and he went to look for him there. He hurried along the riverbank, asking everyone
he passed if they'd seen him go by, but no one said he had. He wasn't alarmed, because
there were other ways to get to our house. Prَspera Arango, the uplander, begged him to do
something for her father, who was in his death throes on the stoop of his house, immune to
the bishop's fleeting blessing. "I'd seen him when I passed," my sister Margot told me, "and
he already had the face of a dead man." Cristo Bedoya delayed four minutes to ascertain the
sick man's condition, and promised to come back later for some emergency treatment, but
he lost three minutes more helping Prَspera Arango carry him into the bedroom. When he
came out again he heard distant shouts and it seemed to him that rockets were being fired in
the direction of the square. He tried to run but was hindered by the revolver, which was
clumsily stuck in his belt. As he turned the last corner he recognised my mother from the
rear as she was practically dragging her youngest son along.
 "Luisa Santiaga," he shouted to her, "where's your godson?"
 My mother barely turned, her face bathed in tears.
 "Oh, my son," she answered, "they say he's been killed!"
 That's how it was. While Cristo Bedoya had been looking for him, Santiago Nasar
had gone into the house of Flora Miguel, his fiancee, just around the corner from where he'd
seen him for the last time. "It didn't occur to me that he could be there," he told me,
"because those people never got up before noon." The version that went around was that the
whole family slept until twelve o'clock on orders from Nahir Miguel, the wise man of the
community. "That's why Flora Miguel, who wasn't that young anymore, was preserved like
a rose," Mercedes says. The truth is that they kept the house locked up until very late, like
so many others, but they were early-rising and hard-working people. The parents of
Santiago Nasar and Flora Miguel had agreed that they should get married. Santiago Nasar
accepted the engagement in the bloom of his adolescence, and he was determined to fulfill 
Chronicle of a Death Foretold 66 Grabriel Garcia Marquez
 
it, perhaps because he had the same utilitarian concept of matrimony as his father. Flora
Miguel, for her part, enjoyed a certain floral quality, but she lacked wit and judgment and
had served as bridesmaid for her whole generation, so the agreement was a providential
solution for her. They had an easy engagement, without formal visits or restless hearts. The
wedding, postponed several times, was finally set for the following Christmas.
 Flora Miguel awoke that Monday with the first bellows of the bishop's boat, and
shortly thereafter she found out that the Vicario twins were waiting for Santiago Nasar to
kill him. She informed my sister the nun, the only one she spoke to after the misfortune,
that she didn't even remember who'd told her. "I only know that at six o'clock in the
morning everybody knew it," she told her. Nevertheless, it seemed inconceivable to her that
they were going to kill Santiago Nasar, but on the other hand, it occurred to her that they
would force him to marry Angela Vicario in order to give her back her honour. She went
through a crisis of humiliation. While half the town was waiting for the bishop, she was in
her bedroom weeping with rage, and putting in order the chestful of letters that Santiago
Nasar had sent her from school.
 Whenever he passed by Flora Miguel's house, even if nobody was home, Santiago
Nasar would scratch his keys across the window screens. That Monday she was waiting
with the chest of letters in her lap. Santiago Nasar couldn't see her from the street, but she,
however, saw him approaching through the screen before he scratched it with his keys.
 "Come in," she told him.
 No one, not even a doctor, had entered that house at six forty-five in the morning.
Santiago Nasar had just left Cristo Bedoya at Yamil Shaium's store, and there were so many
people hanging on his movements in the square that it was difficult to believe that no one
saw him go into his fiancee's house. The investigating magistrate looked for a single person
who'd seen him, and he did so with as much persistence as I, but it was impossible to find
one. In folio 382 of the brief, he wrote another marginal pronouncement in red ink: Fatality
makes us invisible. The fact is that Santiago Nasar went in through the main door, in full
view of everyone, and without doing anything not to be seen. Flora Miguel was waiting for
him in the parlour, green with rage, wearing one of the dresses with unfortunate ruffles that 
Chronicle of a Death Foretold 67 Grabriel Garcia Marquez
 
she was in the habit of putting on for memorable occasions, and she placed the chest in his
hands.
 "Here you are," she told him. "And I hope they kill you!"
 Santiago Nasar was so perplexed that he dropped the chest and his loveless letters
poured out onto the floor. He tried to catch Flora Miguel in the bedroom, but she closed the
door and threw the bolt. He knocked several times, and called her in too pressing a voice
for the time of day, so the whole family came in, all alarmed. Counting relatives by blood
and by marriage, adults and minors, there were more than fourteen of them. The last to
come was Nahir Miguel, the father, with his red beard and the Bedouin caftan he had
brought from his homeland and which he always wore at home. I saw him many times and
he was immense and spare, but what most impressed me was the glow of his authority.
 "Flora," he called in his language. "Open the door."
 He went into his daughter's bedroom while the family stared at Santiago Nasar. He
was kneeling in the parlour, picking up the letters and putting them into the chest. "It looked
like a penance, " they told me. Nahir Miguel came out of the bedroom after a few minutes,
made a signal with his hand, and the whole family disappeared.
 He continued talking in Arabic to Santiago Nasar. "From the first moment I
understood that he didn't have the slightest idea of what I was saying," he told me. Then he
asked him outright if he knew that the Vicario brothers were looking for him to kill him.
"He turned pale and lost control in such a way that it was impossible to think that he was
pretending," he told me. He agreed that his manner reflected not so much fear as confusion.
 "Only you can know if they're right or not," he told him. "But in any case, you've
only got two paths to follow now: either you hide here, in this house which is yours, or you
go out with my rifle."
 "I don't understand a God-damned thing," Santiago Nasar said.
 It was the only thing he managed to say, and he said it in Spanish. "He looked like
a little wet bird," Nahir Miguel told me. He had to take the chest from his hands because he
didn't know where to put it in order to open the door.
 "It'll be two against one," he told him. 
Chronicle of a Death Foretold 68 Grabriel Garcia Marquez
 
 Santiago Nasar left. The people had stationed themselves on the square the way
they did on parade days. They all saw him come out, and they all understood that now he
knew they were going to kill him, and that he was so confused he couldn't find his way
home. They say that someone shouted from a balcony: "Not that way, Turk; by the old
dock." Santiago Nasar sought out the voice. Yamil Shaium shouted for him to get into his
store and went to get his hunting gun, but he couldn't remember where he'd put the
cartridges. They began to shout at him from every side, and Santiago Nasar went backward
and forward several times, baffled by hearing so many voices at the same time. It was
obvious that he was heading toward his house as if to enter through the kitchen door, but
suddenly he must have realised that the main door was open.
 "There he comes," said Pedro Vicario.
 They'd both seen him at the same time. Pablo Vicario took off his jacket, put it on
the bench, and unwrapped his knife, holding it like a scimitar. Before leaving the store,
without any agreement, they both crossed themselves. Then Clotilde Armenta grabbed
Pedro Vicario by the shirt and shouted to Santiago Nasar to run because they were going to
kill him. It was such an urgent shout that it drowned out all the others. "At first he was
startled," Clotilde Armenta told me, "because he didn't know who was shouting at him or
from where." But when he saw her, he also saw Pedro Vicario, who threw her to the ground
and caught up with his brother. Santiago Nasar was less than fifty yards from his house and
he ran to the main door.
 Five minutes before, in the kitchen, Victoria Guzman had told Plلcida Linero what
everybody already knew. Plلcida Linero was a woman of steady nerves, so she didn't let
any sign of alarm show through. She asked Victoria Guzman if she'd said anything to her
son, and she lied honestly, since she answered that she still hadn't known anything when he
came down for coffee. In the living room, where she was still scrubbing the floor, Divina
Flor at the same time saw Santiago Nasar come in through the door on the square and go up
the open stairs to the bedrooms. "It was a very clear vision," Divina Flor told me. "He was
wearing his white suit and carrying something that I couldn't make out well in his hand, but 
Chronicle of a Death Foretold 69 Grabriel Garcia Marquez
 
it looked like a bouquet of roses." So when Plلcida Linero asked about him, Divina Flor
calmed her down.
 "He went up to his room a minute ago," she told her.
 Plلcida Linero then saw the paper on the floor, but she didn't think to pick it up,
and she only found out what it said when someone showed it to her later on during the
confusion of the tragedy. Through the door she saw the Vicario brothers running toward the
house with their knives out. From the place where she was standing she could see them but
she couldn't see her son, who was running toward the door from a different angle. "I
thought they wanted to get in to kill him inside the house," she told me. Then she ran to the
door and slammed it shut. She was putting up the bar when she heard Santiago Nasar's
shouts, and she heard the terrified pounding on the door, but she thought he was upstairs,
insulting the Vicario brothers from the balcony in his room. She went up to help him.
 Santiago Nasar only needed a few seconds to get in when the door closed. He managed
to pound with his fists several times, and he turned at once to face his enemies with his bare
hands. "I was scared when I saw him face on," Pablo Vicario told me, "because he looked
twice as big as he was." Santiago Nasar raised his hand to stop the first strike from Pedro
Vicario, who attacked him on the right side with his knife pointed straight in.
 "Sons of bitches!" he shouted.
 The knife went through the palm of his right hand and then sank into his side up to
the hilt. Everybody heard his cry of pain.
 "Oh, mother of mine!"
 Pedro Vicario pulled out his knife with his slaughterer's iron wrist and dealt him a
second thrust almost in the same place. "The strange thing is that the knife kept coming out
clean," Pedro Vicario declared to the investigator. "I'd given it to him at least three times
and there wasn't a drop of blood." Santiago Nasar twisted after the third stab, his arms
crossed over his stomach, let out the moan of a calf, and tried to turn his back to them.
Pablo Vicario, who was on his left, then gave him the only stab in the back and a spurt of
blood under high pressure soaked his shirt. "It smelled like him," he told me. Mortally
wounded three times, Santiago Nasar turned frontward again and leaned his back against 
Chronicle of a Death Foretold 70 Grabriel Garcia Marquez
 
his mother's door, without the slightest resistance, as if he only wanted to help them finish
killing him by his own contribution. "He didn't cry out again," Pedro Vicario told the
investigator. "Just the opposite: it looked to me as if he was laughing." Then they both kept
on knifing him against the door with alternate and easy stabs, floating in the dazzling
backwater they had found on the other side of fear. They didn't hear the shouts of the whole
